							<p>The first project given to us in the course was the creation of a website. Having no experience with HTML it seemed like a daunting task. But the rescources given to us made this project a lot easier than it seemed at first and more time consuming than hard.</p>

							<p>Never having worked with HTLM before I started by looking through the material provided by the teacher and downloading a telmplate from https://html5up.net
                            
                            To edit the source code Brackets, a source code editor, was used. A free and open-source application created by Adobe systems

							<p>To upload my website Git was used, a version-control system used to track changes in the code during development for any kind of software. Git was used to put in changes to my website repository Github.com. The no cost and and ease of management made Git a prime choice in hosting my website.
                                
                            Here are the download links for Brackets and the seup sites for git.

							<p>After downloading and setting up Bracets and Git a repository was made the template files were uploaded to Brackets. All the files elements, generic and index.html files were accessible and I could start work on the website.
                                
                            The live editor provided by Brackets allowed me to view the changes being made to the wesite as they went. (clicking the lightning icon in the upper right corner)

							<p>      Happy with the current result, the work folder was entered and with a right click on it the "Git bash here" button was presented and selected.
                                
                                
                            With the apperance of a new git window the newest version of the website was uploaded to the correct repository at Github.
                                

                            The final change made was to the repository name to the exact link my website was acsessible through.
